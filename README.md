Final project for Health Informatics - Deep Learning-Based Automatic Diagnosis of Periodontal Diseases from X-rays
# 🦷 Deep Learning-Based Automatic Diagnosis of Periodontal Diseases from X-rays

This is the final project for Health Informatics. It uses YOLOv5 and Grad-CAM to classify dental X-rays for cavity detection with visual explainability.

- Grad-CAM result images (optional - add here if needed)

## 📊 Project Overview
- Framework: YOLOv5 (Ultralytics)
- Dataset: 2,000 dental X-rays (with/without cavity) from Roboflow
- Accuracy Achieved: **91.1%**
- Tools Used: Google Colab, PyTorch, OpenCV, Matplotlib

## 🔍 Dataset Source
